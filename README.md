## Background
The idea for this project comes from wanting to find cool projects on GitHub but not being satisfied with GitHub's native search.

I began searching issues during [Hacktoberfest](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-got-my-free-hacktoberfest-shirt-heres-a-quick-way-you-can-get-yours-fa78d6e24307) (an annual event sponsored by Digital Ocean which encourages developers to get involved with open source. Make 5 PRs in a month and get a FREE T-shirt 👕).



## Technologies used
* This is a React project initialized with create-react-app
* GitHub corner icon from [GitHub corners](http://tholman.com/github-corners/)
* Packages used:
  * moment
  * eslint and prettier
  * [react-toggle](http://aaronshaf.github.io/react-toggle/)
  * [react-spinner](https://www.react-spinners.com)



## Future Development
Potential ideas for further development:
* Add pagination to search results
* Create the ability for a user to search with custom labels/languages
* Add a debounce to the `Get Issues` button
* Refine styling for search results/entire app



## Personal Highlights

My goal it to have a fun side project that will also be useful. My favorite part has been creating the logic for the [formatting utils](https://github.com/trybick/issue-collab/blob/master/src/utils/formatting.js) functions.



## Local development

To run this project for local development if you have Node.js and NPM
installed follow these steps in a terminal. The app will run on port 3000.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If you don't want to install Node.js and you have Docker present on your
system, then just use the ``Dockerfile`` and the script that prepares
the whole application in a separate container. The app will run on port 3000.

```bash
./dev.sh
```
