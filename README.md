## Background

The idea for this project comes from wanting to find cool projects on GitHub but not being satisfied with GitHub's native search.

I began searching issues during [Hacktoberfest](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-just-got-my-free-hacktoberfest-shirt-heres-a-quick-way-you-can-get-yours-fa78d6e24307) (an annual event sponsored by Digital Ocean which encourages developers to get involved with open source. Make 4 PRs in a month and get a FREE T-shirt ðŸ‘•).

## Local Development

To run this project for local development if you have Node.js and NPM
installed follow these steps in a terminal. The app will run on port 3000.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If you don't want to install Node.js and you have Docker present on your
system, then just use the `Dockerfile` and the script that prepares
the whole application in a separate container. The app will run on port 3000.

```bash
./dev.sh
```
